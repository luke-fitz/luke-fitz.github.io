title: "Euchre Simulator"
---
<p>
  I simulated the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euchre">euchre</a> card game in Python.
</p>

<p>
  It's a cool little simulation, and is easily extensible to other variations of euchre or to user-vs-computer gameplay.
</p>

<p>
  Some people say that euchre is a poor man's bridge, and the results suggest that these people are exactly right. A player bidding randomly would still win 21% of their games. A player bidding <i>and playing</i> randomly would win 10%. These numbers seem absurdly high for a venerable card game. A trained monkey could probably win a world championship with an ounce of luck.
</p>

<h2>Bidding</h2>
<p>
  After simulating millions of hands of euchre, I modelled the results down to the following strategy which is not too difficult to remember.
</p>

<h3>1. Calculate your hand's score according to this table.</h3>

<style type="text/css">
.tg  {border-collapse:collapse;border-spacing:0;}
.tg td{border-color:black;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;
  overflow:hidden;padding:10px 5px;word-break:normal;}
.tg th{border-color:black;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;
  font-weight:bold;overflow:hidden;padding:10px 5px;word-break:normal;}
.tg .tg-0pky{border-color:inherit;text-align:left;vertical-align:top}
</style>
<table class="tg">
<thead>
  <tr>
    <th class="tg-0pky">(A) Number of Trumps</th>
    <th class="tg-0pky">(B) Trump Cards</th>
    <th class="tg-0pky">(C) Offsuit Cards</th>
    <th class="tg-0pky">(D) Flipped Card Penalty*</th>
  </tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td class="tg-0pky">1 =   1<br>     2 = 2<br>     3 = 6<br>     4 = 9<br>     5 = 12</td>
    <td class="tg-0pky">J<sub>Right</sub> = 10<br>     J<sub>Left</sub> = 8<br>     A = 6<br>     K = 5<br>     Q, T = 4<br>     9, 8, 7 = 3</td>
    <td class="tg-0pky">A = 4 each<br>     K = 1 each</td>
    <td class="tg-0pky">J = -5<br>     A = -2 <br><br> <i>* Only applies during the first round of bidding and if your opponent is the dealer.</i></td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>
  Your score is (A) + (B) + (C) + (D).
</p>

<h3>2. If your score is higher than the threshold for your position, then make the call. Otherwise pass.</h3>

<p>
  Although this is an elaborate set of rules, it would win only about 51% of games when the other three players follow a simple trump-counting bidding strategy. How much better could a more sophisticated version be? Eventually it would be nice to use this simulator to generate training data for an ML model of optimal bidding strategy. 
</p>

<p>
  Of course, the best strategy also depends on the other players &mdash;  if your opponents bid more cautiously then you should be more cautious too. The game situation could also be taken into account.
</p>

<h2>Playing</h2>
<p>
  The simulator uses a rule-based approach for choosing cards. Its first-order approximation is:
<ol>
  <li style="font-weight: bold;">Golden rule</li>
  <ol type="a">
    <li>If you made trumps and the outcome of the hand is still uncertain, keep one trump in your hand as a saver.</li>
  </ol>
  <li style="font-weight: bold;">First card in trick</li>
  <ol type="a">
    <li>If your team made trumps, lead your best trump card.</li>
    <li>If your opponents made trumps, lead your best offsuit card.</li>
  </ol>
  <li style="font-weight: bold;">Second or third card in trick</li>
  <ol type="a">
    <li>If all your cards would lose, or you think your partner's lead card will win, or you made trumps and are VERY nervous, then throw away your weakest card.</li>
    <li>Otherwise, take the lead in the trick with either your strongest offsuit (if you can follow suit) or your weakest trump.</li>
  </ol>
  <li style="font-weight: bold;">Last card in trick</li>
  <ol type="a">
    <li>If your opponents are leading the trick and you can win it and it wouldn't break the golden rule, then play your weakest card that wins the trick.</li>
    <li> Otherwise, throw away your weakest card.</li>
  </ol>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
  I tried to run experiments where I varied this strategy, but couldn't come up with anything better.
