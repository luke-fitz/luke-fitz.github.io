title: "Statistics Without Borders Statistics Courses"
---

A set of [open online statistics courses](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_B9IFL3z8bB1Ml6GcVDavA/playlists) from Statistics Without Borders volunteers, which I helped to edit.

Statistics Without Borders is a voluntary outreach group of the American Statistical Association that provides pro bono statistical and data science services. They work to improve human welfare by providing empirical knowledge using proper applications of statistical principles and best practices so that their clients can make more informed decisions.
