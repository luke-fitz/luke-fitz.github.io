I am dedicated to solving the right problem and delivering the right solution through the use of data, analytics and modeling.

My goal is to apply innovative approaches to create value for organisations and to help solve important real-world problems. The ability to effect positive, far-reaching change by combining data analytics with human ingenuity is a major motivating factor.

In my spare time, I am enthusiastic but generally quite uncoordinated at most sports I turn my hand to, including cricket, tennis, running, touch football and swimming.

These pages contain a few side projects from over the years. For example, during a recent quarantine I made [my own version of the Fox Cricket predictor](https://lukefitzpatrick.pythonanywhere.com).
